#Leetcode And Algorithm

As a wild programmer, it is my first time to brush the topic. I have to say, I need a good offer.

##Note

The whole source code is a Java Project, you can clone or download to compile by IDE completely.

There are two parts. One is the Java Source Code of the leetcode, and I will update the C++ version after the first time. The other is the something about algorithm.

All the code had been tested. And at the same time, I will write down my thought in [my blog](www.yzhou9071.com).

I'm a fresher, and please advice. Thank you!
